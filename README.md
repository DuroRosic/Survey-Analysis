## 🧾 Project Overview

- 💬 7,000+ survey responses
- 📊 12 Likert-scale questions, 1 binary, 2 open-text
- 🧼 Fully anonymized and obfuscated to protect original context
- 📈 Focus on patterns, distributions, and EDA techniques

> 🚨 All data shown here has been anonymized and stripped of real-world identifiers or insights. This project focuses on demonstrating **process and technique** under data privacy constraints.

## 🧪 Goals

- Demonstrate a full EDA workflow on realistic survey data
- Highlight privacy-conscious data handling and anonymization
- Use visualizations to explore trends, sentiment, and engagement

## 🛠️ Techniques Used

- SHA-256 hashing with custom prefixes for identifier obfuscation
- Timestamp shifting to preserve temporal structure
- Free-text entity replacement & POS-based word substitution
- Normalization of Likert-scale responses into sentiment categories
- Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, nltk/spacy-based text preprocessing

## 🎯 Project Highlights

- Realistic survey data structure with anonymized content
- Custom preprocessing and privacy-preserving pipeline
- Demonstrates transferable skills in survey analytics, sentiment modeling, and data storytelling
